# MEA_analysis_GUI
Contains all files for the Matlab GUI to analyse MEA data (using the spatial stimulator: https://github.com/BadenLab/Open-Visual-Stimulator)

The best way to "install" the app, is to clone the git repository and launch the MEA_analysis.mlapp file using appdesigner in Matlab. 
An easier but potentially more crash-likely way is to download the installation file MEA_analysis.mlappinstall and run it in Matlab. Matlab will than add this app to the TAB "APPS" in Matlab from where you can run it.
